 -- About --

This is an SVG document I created for Wikipedia.  It is an interactive table of the elements.

Wikipedia won't allow it because has Javascript in it.  If I take the Javascript out, it won't be interactive, so Wikipedia is a no go.

It could stand some improvements for general consumption.  
It is a fixed size as is.  It could have other modes, like fullscreen, zoom levels, nothing complex.

It uses desktop events, mouseover I think.  Adding tablet events should be easy enough.
